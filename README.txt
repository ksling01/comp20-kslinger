1.What is this purpose of this Git repository?
The purpose of this repository is store all work done in the Comp20 calss at Tufts Universtiy. These assignments are meant to explore different parts of web development.

2.What was your favorite assignment and why?
My favorite assignment in the class was the first one where we created a personal page with our resumes. I already had one but I had almost no idea how to eidt it. This website is something I will continue to update as I continue my web development. I really enjoy writing in HTML ans CSS.

3.How much do yo think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have gained a much bigger appercitaion for the complexity of the web and the amount of time it takes to build. I was under the simple understanding that it was likr editing and word document. The complexity scares and interests me to what else can be done. I Know know how to be much safer on the web.

4.What was the most important things you ;earned in this course?
I think that learning the how to use and write API in the websites is huge. Being able to integrate other peoples work into your own is huge and can really help you out so you don't have to do any of it yourself.

I also thing that learning a little about securtiy is very important. A lof of people do not understand what is happening when they browse the web. Being able t understand a bit about how attacking works gives me a huge head up on how to defend myself against these kids of things. 

5.Now that you have finished this course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I am very interested in the front end development of these websites. I enjoy writing the HTMl and CSS to do whatever I want it to. I would like to leanr how to do more dynamic front end work so I can use that to build websites.
