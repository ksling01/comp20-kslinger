For security concerns javascript is not allowed to load data from a different origin.
It is also not allowed to load data from your local machine.

It does this so sites cannot see what you have done on other domains and cannot steal any information that is stored on your computer and not meant to be shared on the web. 

This makes your computer much less vulnerable for sites to take information without your consent.
