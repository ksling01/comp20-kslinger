<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p> 
This assessment tests the security of <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html"> Marauders Map </a> 
web application created by Sam Broner for <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/"> Comp20</a> assignment 5. Marauders Map is 
is a web application that takes in a user's 
longitude and latitude placement and plots them on a map when they log in. The user can then see where all the other users have logged in and how far away they are from the user. Although this application runs smoothly when operated correctly, there are many vulnerabilities in the application where false information could be supplied or data taken from the site. 
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this assessment is to show where attacks could be made on this particular application. 
</p>
<h2>
Methodology
</h2>
<p> 
Testing was first done without looking into any of the source code. This was to simulate the conditions of a normal attacker. Only to components that they viewed were looked at. After that had been fully exploited the source code was looked at to expose the code further. Vulnerabilities were found on both tests.
